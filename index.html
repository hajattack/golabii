  Redesign of the Golabii landing page

  This page is a fresh take on the original golabii.com waitlist site.
  It uses a minimal hero layout inspired by the provided inspiration
  screenshot. The hero features a large brand name and supporting
  taglines centred on the page with decorative product imagery
  positioned around the edges. A prominent call‑to‑action button
  encourages visitors to join the waitlist. All fonts are loaded
  from Google Fonts and are free to use commercially.
